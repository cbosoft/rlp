# RLP: Really Lame Packer

Rather Lively Peacock forms configurations of red little particles in random
loose packing (minimum concentration for self-supporting structures).

# Status

Randy Looking Porcupines is in almost there. The racontour-like particles are
settling in a manner like Random Loose Packing (i.e. volume fraction approx 0.55
for monodisperse spheres). Rampant Lavish Peas is slow, but it works (for
monodisperse spheres). It's slow, so I'm going to re-write it in C++, now that I
have the basic algorithm sorted.

# TODO

  - [ ] Add polydispersity
  - [ ] Re-write in C++
